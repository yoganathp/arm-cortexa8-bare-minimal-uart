## ðŸ“– About

Minimal bare-metal UART example for ARM Cortex-A8 using assembly startup and linker script, running on QEMU versatilepb. Ideal for embedded systems learning and experimenting with low-level ARM programming.

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

This project is part of my personal learning journey into embedded systems programming. It demonstrates a minimal bare-metal UART "Hello World" example on the ARM Cortex-A8 CPU, emulated on QEMU versatilepb.

It aims to deepen understanding of bare-metal ARM development and to share insights with others. ðŸ’¡
